# pzsvc-sdk-go

This may in the end be an awful name, as I'm not really setting out to create a full-fledged SDK. What it is, for now, is a place for common components that I'm using in my Go-based Piazza services. Things like structs defining JSON messages for job creation, S3 upload/download helper utilities, etc.
